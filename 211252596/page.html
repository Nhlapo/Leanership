	I have been hearing wisdom from tongues I did not want to listen. I have been finding beauty where I did not want to look.
	And I have learned so much from journeys I did not want to take. Forgive me, O Gracious One; for I have been closing my ears and eyes for too long.
	I have learned that miracles are only called miracles because they are often witnessed by only those who can can see through all of life's illusions.
	I am ready to see what really exists on other side, what exists behind the blinds, and taste all the ugly fruit instead of all that looks right, plump and ripe.”
